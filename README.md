# Tweet Cards 



## Documentation

- This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- The project is made according to the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/zun1oP6NmS2Lmgbcj6e1IG/Test?node-id=0%3A1&t=VoiYTfiXggVItgVd-1).


## Features

- When the "Follow" button is clicked, the text and style of the button should change. The follower count should also increase by one. For example, if the initial follower count is 100,500, it should become 100,501 after clicking the button.

- When the button is clicked again, its text, color, and follower count should return to the initial state. The follower count should decrease by one (for example, from 100,501 to 100,500).

- The application should have the following routes. '/' - Home - the home page. '/tweets' - Tweets - page displaying tweets.  If the user enters a non-existent route, they should be redirected to the home page. On the tweets page, there should be a Back button that leads to the home page.

- Add filtering functionality for the cards.
